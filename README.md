# 📱 BMI Calculator App (Flutter)

This is my **BMI Calculator App project** made using Flutter.  
It is a **fun and interactive app** where the user can set **Height** and **Weight** using sliders, and the app will **calculate and display the BMI instantly**.  
The app also shows the **BMI category** (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese) with **colors and emojis**.
